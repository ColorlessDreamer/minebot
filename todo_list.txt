##TOFIX
EntityHurt tracks all entities that have been hurt.
EntityAttribute tracks me and probably other entities far away as well
Technicall toadd, but BRO CAN'T SWIM
The follow action seems broken


##TOADD
Next implementations:
- (DONE) **Slight wandering when idle**
- (DONE) **Looking around when idle**
- Block recognition (dear God help me)
- Multiple Actions at the same time (Follow and chat, dance and talk) 
- (DONE) **Damage/Hit recognition**
- Hit response/counterattack
- Block destruction
- Looking into openai vector stores/fine-tuning
- Voice?

##REFACTORING
- Change the controller to Atomic Agents
